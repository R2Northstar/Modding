Contributing to ModdingDocs
===========================

All contributions to ModdingDocs are welcome. To add a change simply make a pull request to the `ModdingDocs repo <https://github.com/R2Northstar/ModdingDocs/>`_.

ModdingDocs uses `reStructuredText <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_.

A cheatsheet for reStructuredText syntax can be found here: https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/6.2/rst-cheatsheet.html

The ``.rst`` files can be found in the ``docs/source`` directory. If you're adding a new file, make sure to link it in ``index.rst``

Contributing without a local build
----------------------------------
You don't necessarily need to set up a local build environment.

To contribute without doing so, you can just edit the files in an editor of your choice and create a GitHub pull request from them.

There will be a test-build done for each PR, which you can find on your PR as a "Check" by clicking ``show all checks`` and ``details``.

This should take you to a online version of the docs with your PRs changes. 


Building locally
----------------

First, you need to have a relatively recent version of Python installed - 3.8 or higher. `Download here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_

tl:dr;
^^^^^^

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/R2Northstar/ModdingDocs/
    cd ModdingDocs
    py -m pip install poetry
    poetry install
    poetry run build

Explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^

Open a terminal wherever you want the files to end up and clone the `ModdingDocs repo <https://github.com/R2Northstar/ModdingDocs/>`_, e.g.


.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/R2Northstar/ModdingDocs/
    cd ModdingDocs

Your terminal should now be open in the ModdingDocs folder.

Next, on Windows do:

.. code:: bash

    # Install Poetry, the build tool used by ModdingDocs
    py -m pip install poetry

For other OSs replace ``py`` with ``python3`` or whichever python executable you prefer.

Now, tell poetry to install this project.

.. code:: bash

    poetry install

After this is done downloading and setting up all the dependencies, you can build it with:

.. code:: bash

    poetry run build

This should rebuild the docs on changes and open them in your default browser with live reloading.
