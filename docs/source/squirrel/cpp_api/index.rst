C++ Squirrel API
================

The Squirrel VMs can be manipulated and controlled by Northstar and Plugins.

All functions and macros documented are defined and used in the Northstar Client. For plugins it's recommended to use F1F7Y's `template
<https://github.com/F1F7Y/R2PluginTemplate>`_. The sq API used from Northstar is mirrored there to an extend.
