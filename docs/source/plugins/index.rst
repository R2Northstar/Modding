Plugins
=======

While regular mods are restricted to options provided by the game and Northstar, Plugins have no such limitations.

Plugins are dynamically linked libraries that get loaded by the Northstar Launcher. As such plugins can do anything the launcher could, like adding new squirrel functions or hooking the game.
